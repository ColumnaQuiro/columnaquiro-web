            "body": "To become a chiropractor, obtaining a university degree in Chiropractic and a Doctorate in Chiropractic is required, after completing a 5 to 7-year study program. Both degrees are recognized by the European Council on Chiropractic Education (ECCE). The career's beginning is similar to medicine, as disciplines like anatomy, radiology, epidemiology, nutrition, and pathophysiology are studied, with a specific focus on each population type, including babies, pregnant women, seniors, and athletes. Throughout the career, knowledge in chiropractic techniques is also acquired. The last two years are dedicated to practical experience, where students become interns in the school clinic under faculty supervision, attending patients of different ages and profiles to gain comprehensive experience before graduation."

            "body": "Health cannot be defined solely as the absence of pain or symptoms. Adopting a preventive approach involves making proactive decisions that allow us to limit disease and optimize our health before symptoms appear. Preventive chiropractic care plays a fundamental role in addressing imbalances and dysfunctions in the body before they manifest as pain or evident symptoms. By maintaining a healthy nervous system and proper spinal alignment, we can promote optimal body function, prevent future problems, and improve overall quality of life."

            "body": "Chiropractic is a health profession that focuses on promoting the proper functioning of the nervous system and the body as a whole. Its goal is not just to relieve symptoms but to achieve a healthy body free of nerve interference. Chiropractic maintenance is recommended to preserve and improve current health, prevent relapses, and address stress factors that may affect the nervous system and the body in general. Regular chiropractic treatments aim to maintain proper spinal alignment and strengthen the body to prevent future complications."

While chiropractic has its origins in the United States, it has developed widely in advanced countries like Australia and Europe. In Spain, chiropractic is experiencing gradual growth with the support of the Spanish Chiropractic Association (AEQ). It is essential to ensure that the chiropractor you visit is a member of the AEQ, the only entity guaranteeing chiropractic diplomas and regulating the profession in Spain. The growing presence and endorsement of the AEQ provide more confidence to those seeking chiropractic services in Spain, and as chiropractic consolidates in the country, more people are expected to benefit from its holistic approaches to health and well-being."

I began my first two years of study at IFEC in France and then decided to move to Spain. During my training, I also had the opportunity to work as a technique teacher and clinic supervisor at the Barcelona College of Chiropractic. After obtaining my diploma, I worked in a chiropractic practice in Barcelona, applying my knowledge and skills in chiropractic care. I have attended numerous seminars and chiropractic courses during and after my studies, allowing me to expand my knowledge and incorporate various techniques for personalized patient care. Some of the adjustment techniques I use include SOT (Sacro Occipital Technique), Applied Kinesiology, Gonstead, Total Body Modification, Toggle Recoil-Hole in One Technique, and Webster Technique. Each of these techniques has its characteristics and approaches, and I adapt them based on the individual needs of each patient. My goal is to provide comprehensive and effective chiropractic care to help restore balance and promote health and well-being in each person I treat.

As chiropractors, our goal is to establish a care plan tailored to the individual needs of each patient, including analyzing different tests during the first visit. Some symptoms or conditions may improve after a few sessions, while more chronic conditions may require more time. It's important to collaborate in your own health by following the recommended care plan for excellent and lasting results.

Remember that each case is unique, and results may vary. Our commitment is to provide you with the best care and work together to help you achieve your health goals.

In our center, we have specialized training and courses in pediatrics to attend to children, as well as certification in the Webster Technique for pregnant women. Each adjustment technique we apply is extremely gentle and adapted to the spinal column of people of different ages, including children. We also consider the changes that occur in the body during pregnancy, ensuring a safe approach tailored to the needs of pregnant women. Many parents choose to bring their children to the chiropractor to correct any back or cranial dysfunction and improve overall health. Identifying and addressing these dysfunctions at an early age can contribute to the proper development of the child in later stages of life. In the case of pregnancy, chiropractic care can provide many benefits in preparing for childbirth and the proper development of pregnancy, helping to maintain good health and reduce dysfunction in the mother.

These reactions are normal and part of the healing and adjustment process of the nervous system. Some possible responses you could experience include a sense of relief, internal changes, and temporary fatigue or discomfort. Each person may have a different experience after chiropractic treatment, as each body reacts uniquely. If you have specific concerns or questions about the reactions you are experiencing, we recommend consulting with your chiropractor, who can provide additional guidance and support.

            "title": "Are chiropractic adjustments painful?",
            "body": "No, chiropractic adjustments are not painful. In fact, most people experience a sense of relaxation and reduced tension after chiropractic adjustments. The adjustments focus on the spine and are performed using quick, low-amplitude impulses that stimulate the body's nerve receptors. These adjustments are designed to restore the proper balance and alignment of the spine, relieving pressure and nerve interference. During the adjustment, you may hear a sound similar to a crack. This sound is due to the release of gases in the joints, a result of pressure changes during the adjustment. It's essential to note that this sound is not indicative of pain or joint damage. Each person may experience the sensations of chiropractic adjustments differently. Open communication with your chiropractor is crucial, and expressing any concerns or sensitivities you may have is encouraged. Chiropractic is a safe and effective practice for improving health and nervous system function without causing unnecessary pain. If you have additional questions or want to know more about chiropractic adjustments, feel free to consult with your chiropractor."
          },
          {
            "title": "What causes the 'crack' sound during chiropractic adjustments?",
            "body": "The 'crack' sound during chiropractic adjustments is not the result of bones breaking. Instead, this sound is due to the phenomenon of cavitation, which occurs when synovial fluid in the joints is subjected to pressure, causing the vaporization of gases like nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide. This sudden release of gases is what generates the characteristic sound. It's important to emphasize that the 'crack' sound doesn't necessarily indicate a successful or beneficial adjustment. This sound is simply a natural consequence of synovial fluid cavitation and is not directly related to the proper functioning of the joint. The sound cannot be reproduced immediately, as gases naturally reorganize and dissolve back into the joint fluid as pressure increases. While joint cracking can occur naturally during movements like bending or moving the hands, deliberately cracking joints, like fingers, is not recommended. It can lead to dependence and is not related to the benefits of chiropractic adjustments performed by a trained professional. If you have additional questions or want more information about the 'crack' sound during chiropractic adjustments, we recommend consulting with your chiropractor for a more detailed and personalized explanation."

As for regular adjustments, they are performed in a closed room and tailored to the specific needs of your body. Their duration typically ranges between 15 and 20 minutes. Throughout the treatment process, we will conduct reviews by comparing your initial test results with current ones to assess your improvements and adjust your care plan as needed.
