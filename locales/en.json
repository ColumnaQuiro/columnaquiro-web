When vertebrae are misaligned, they can interfere with communication between the brain and body. Chiropractic adjustments can restore this communication, allowing the body to function more efficiently and respond better to stress.</p><h3>Increased relaxation</h3><p>Chiropractic manipulation techniques not only relieve pain but also reduce muscle tension and promote relaxation. This can help people feel more relaxed and less anxious.</p><h3>Better sleep quality</h3><p>Stress and chronic pain often affect sleep quality.

Chiropractic can play a significant role in helping the body adapt to and recover from stress by improving the function of the nervous system. Recognizing these different types of stress and understanding how our body adapts to them is crucial. Chiropractic can contribute to the body's adaptation and recovery from stress by enhancing the function of the nervous system, promoting balance, and overall health."

            "body": "I graduated from the Barcelona College of Chiropractic in 2021 after completing a 6-year program. I began my first two years of study at IFEC in France and then decided to move to Spain. During my training, I also had the opportunity to work as a technique teacher and clinic supervisor at the Barcelona College of Chiropractic. After obtaining my diploma, I worked in a chiropractic practice in Barcelona, applying my knowledge and skills in chiropractic care. I have attended numerous seminars and chiropractic courses during and after my studies, allowing me to expand my knowledge and incorporate various techniques for personalized patient care. Some of the adjustment techniques I use include SOT (Sacro Occipital Technique), Applied Kinesiology, Gonstead, Total Body Modification, Toggle Recoil-Hole in One Technique, and Webster Technique. Each of these techniques has its characteristics and approaches, and I adapt them based on the individual needs of each patient. My goal is to provide comprehensive and effective chiropractic care to help restore balance and promote health and well-being in each person I treat. If you have specific questions about the techniques I use or are interested in learning more, feel free to ask."

            "body": "The perception of changes can vary from person to person, as each body has its own capacity for expression and recovery. As chiropractors, our goal is to establish a care plan tailored to the individual needs of each patient, including analyzing different tests during the first visit. Some symptoms or conditions may improve after a few sessions, while more chronic conditions may require more time. It's important to collaborate in your own health by following the recommended care plan for excellent and lasting results. We will also conduct regular reviews to monitor your progress and adjust the care plan as needed to ensure you feel your best and experience health improvements. Remember that each case is unique, and results may vary. Our commitment is to provide you with the best care and work together to help you achieve your health goals.

            "body": "Yes, it is safe to visit the chiropractor during pregnancy and for children. In our center, we have specialized training and courses in pediatrics to attend to children, as well as certification in the Webster Technique for pregnant women. Each adjustment technique we apply is extremely gentle and adapted to the spinal column of people of different ages, including children. We also consider the changes that occur in the body during pregnancy, ensuring a safe approach tailored to the needs of pregnant women. Many parents choose to bring their children to the chiropractor to correct any back or cranial dysfunction and improve overall health. Identifying and addressing these dysfunctions at an early age can contribute to the proper development of the child in later stages of life. In the case of pregnancy, chiropractic care can provide many benefits in preparing for childbirth and the proper development of pregnancy, helping to maintain good health and reduce dysfunction in the mother. If you have more questions or want more information about chiropractic care during pregnancy or for children, feel free to consult with our chiropractic team. We are here to provide the right care and support during these special stages of life."

            "body": "After receiving chiropractic care, you may experience different reactions in your body. These reactions are normal and part of the healing and adjustment process of the nervous system. Some possible responses you could experience include a sense of relief, internal changes, and temporary fatigue or discomfort. Each person may have a different experience after chiropractic care, as each body reacts uniquely. If you have specific concerns or questions about the reactions you are experiencing, we recommend consulting with your chiropractor, who can provide additional guidance and support. Remember that these changes and reactions are part of your recovery process, and your chiropractor is there to help you at each stage of the journey toward better health and well-being."

            "title": "Are chiropractic adjustments painful?",
            "body": "No, chiropractic adjustments are not painful. In fact, most people experience a sense of relaxation and reduced tension after chiropractic adjustments. The adjustments focus on the spine and are performed using quick, low-amplitude impulses that stimulate the body's nerve receptors. These adjustments are designed to restore the proper balance and alignment of the spine, relieving pressure and nerve interference. During the adjustment, you may hear a sound similar to a crack. This sound is due to the release of gases in the joints, a result of pressure changes during the adjustment. It's essential to note that this sound is not indicative of pain or joint damage. Each person may experience the sensations of chiropractic adjustments differently. Open communication with your chiropractor is crucial, and expressing any concerns or sensitivities you may have is encouraged. Chiropractic is a safe and effective practice for improving health and nervous system function without causing unnecessary pain. If you have additional questions or want to know more about chiropractic adjustments, feel free to consult with your chiropractor."
          },
          {
            "title": "What causes the 'crack' sound during chiropractic adjustments?",
            "body": "The 'crack' sound during chiropractic adjustments is not the result of bones breaking. Instead, this sound is due to the phenomenon of cavitation, which occurs when synovial fluid in the joints is subjected to pressure, causing the vaporization of gases like nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide. This sudden release of gases is what generates the characteristic sound. It's important to emphasize that the 'crack' sound doesn't necessarily indicate a successful or beneficial adjustment. This sound is simply a natural consequence of synovial fluid cavitation and is not directly related to the proper functioning of the joint. The sound cannot be reproduced immediately, as gases naturally reorganize and dissolve back into the joint fluid as pressure increases. While joint cracking can occur naturally during movements like bending or moving the hands, deliberately cracking joints, like fingers, is not recommended. It can lead to dependence and is not related to the benefits of chiropractic adjustments performed by a trained professional. If you have additional questions or want more information about the 'crack' sound during chiropractic adjustments, we recommend consulting with your chiropractor for a more detailed and personalized explanation."

We will focus on your first visit results to get a precise idea of your case and spinal dysfunctions. This visit usually lasts about 60 minutes. During this time, we will make sure to listen to your concerns, gather your medical history, and perform the necessary assessments to design a personalized care plan. As for regular adjustments, they are performed in a closed room and tailored to the specific needs of your body. Their duration typically ranges between 15 and 20 minutes. Throughout the care process, we will conduct reviews by comparing your initial test results with current ones to assess your improvements and adjust your care plan as needed. These reviews allow us to monitor your progress and ensure you are receiving the most suitable care at each stage of your care. Our goal is to provide you with quality and personalized care tailored to your individual needs.

I am a sports enthusiast and have always been very active in my life, so I understand the importance of having a healthy, adaptable body that functions at its maximum potential.<br><br>Since birth, I have had various health problems related to the musculoskeletal system, which prevented me from playing sports and climbing stairs at the age of 13. By chance, I ended up in a manual therapy center in France where I noticed significant improvements in my health and overall well-being.<br><br>That's when I decided to study a profession related to manual therapies, and upon discovering the philosophy of chiropractic, I knew that helping create a healthier, sustainable, and happier humanity through chiropractic care would be my calling.<br><br>After six years of studies between France (two years) and Barcelona (four years), I graduated in 2021 from the Barcelona College of Chiropractic. Since then, I have collaborated in different clinics, learning from the masters of the profession and practicing with different techniques and approaches in Barcelona and the province of Barcelona (Terrassa). I have also been an assistant teacher in different technique classes and a supervisor at the clinic of the Barcelona College of Chiropractic, as I have always enjoyed teaching and helping as many people as possible.<br><br>Since my graduation, I have continued to educate myself to expand my knowledge and skills to offer the best care to my patients. Recently, I have specialized in a holistic approach for pregnant women and children, allowing me to provide more comprehensive and personalized care to these populations.<br><br>For me, ColumnaQuiro goes beyond being a chiropractic center. It is a humanistic project that empowers the population from the inside out, helping each individual understand that health comes from within and its importance.<br><br>I am excited to welcome everyone seeking a natural and effective way to improve their health at ColumnaQuiro, and I look forward to helping them with open arms!",
